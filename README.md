## Passport-ADFS

POC to establish azure active directory authentication via node express app.

the server created in app.js expects a self signed certificate to be present in the ~/ssl directory.

You can create one of these very easily with [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/): <https://gist.github.com/GuyHarwood/94a2e91bd0223ad49a9c#file-selfsignedcert-sh>
